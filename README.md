# DisplaySeismic
I have written a python code to display seismic data in segy format using segyio library. I also extracted two seismic attributes; Amplitude and Instantaneous Frequency attributes from the seismic data. The data used was the F3 Demo data from The Netherlands downloaded from https://terranubis.com/datainfo/F3-Demo-2020.
